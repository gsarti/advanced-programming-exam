# Advanced Programming Exam

_*By [Gabriele Sarti](https://github.com/gsarti) & [Giulia Franco](https://github.com/GiuliaFranco)*_

A collaborative work repository for the [Advanced Programming course](https://github.com/asartori86/advanced_programming-2018-19) exam of DSSC MSc @ UniTS/SISSA.

The project was divided in two parts:

* In the `c++` folder, a custom templated binary search tree was implemented, tested and benchmarked against standard library's map in order to assess its performances. A short report is available in the same folder, along with a readme explaining its contents.

* In the `python` folder, the PostcardList class was implemented to read and write postcard addresses on text files. The folder also contains the mandatory unit tests for the class and some files used to test it.
